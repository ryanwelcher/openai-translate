## Translation tool using OpenAI

This is a tool I put together to test translating large amounts of text via OpenAI.

## Usage

1. Put a file called `input.txt` into the source directory containing the text you want to translate.
2. Change the `LANGUAGE` constant in `constants.js` i.e `Spanish`, `German` etc 
3. Run `npm start` to start translating the file
4. Translation will appear in `translated/output.txt`
