## Translation tool using OpenAI

This is a tool I put together to test translating large amounts of text via OpenAI.

## Usage

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Put a file called `input.txt` into the source directory containing the text you want to translate.
3. Change the `LANGUAGE` constant in `constants.js` i.e `Spanish`, `German` etc 
4. Run `npm start` to start translating the file
5. Translation will appear in `translated/output.txt`
